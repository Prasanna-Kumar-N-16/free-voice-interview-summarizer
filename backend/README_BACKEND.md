# Backend Application Documentation

## Overview
This backend application serves as the server-side component of the project. It is responsible for handling requests, processing data, and interacting with the database. The application is built using Python and utilizes various libraries for natural language processing and database management.

## Project Structure
The backend directory contains the following files:

- **Dockerfile**: Instructions to build a Docker image for the backend application.
- **main.py**: The main entry point of the application, containing the application logic and server startup code.
- **models/**: A directory containing Python modules that define the data models used in the application.
- **db.py**: Contains the database connection logic and functions for interacting with the database.
- **nlp.py**: Contains functions and classes for performing natural language processing tasks.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the Python dependencies required for the backend application.
